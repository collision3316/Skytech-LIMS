        <br>
        <p>Skytech Laboritory Information Management System is a web-app designed to run on any server.
            It is a light-weight application that requires no specialized hardware for operation. Version 1.0
            is the first installment with expectations of future updates for a streamlined user experience.<br>
            Features include:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Sample Tracking</li>
                <li>Workflow Organization</li>
                <li>Inventory Management</li>
                <li>Personnel Management</li>
                <li>Testing History</li>
                <li>User Accounts</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Sample Tracking</h2>
            The sample tracking module allows recorded samples to be viewed by all users. Users having 
            administrator privileges can add new entries and delete existing ones. Sample location within 
            the facility is also captured together with the details of the client who brought in the sample.
            <br>
            <h2>Workflow Organization</h2>
            This module has an easy to use WYSIWYG content management system to allow admin users to create
            articles detailing protocols, procedures, and what ever they deem relevant and publish them to
            the platform for all users to peruse. This can also be used as a notice board of sorts.
            <br>
            <h2>Inventory Management</h2>
            Inventory management keeps a record of lab materials. It enables the user to manage the ordering of
             new material and the removal of items from stock.
             <br>
             <h2>Personnel Management</h2>
             This module keeps track of laboratory staff, their positions, and their contact details. This is 
             useful as it is able to accurately fetch employee details in record time with search happening in 
             real-time as the user types.

             <h2>Testing History</h2>
             This is a record of all the tests ever performed in the laboratory. This remains persistent even after
              the sample record has been dropped from the samples tables. This allows the client to be able to keep 
              an accurate record of what test was performed for which company on what date.
              <br>
              <h2>User Accounts</h2>
              User account management is mostly done by admin users. Ordinary users can change 
              the password of their accounts without any special permissions. Regular password change 
              is recommended for security's sake. Admin users are the only ones that can create accounts.
